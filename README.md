# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app developed is an inventory tracking application, its designed to authenticate an end user using a password and user-id to ensure only authorized edits take place.
After a user is signed in the application is designed to add, remove, increase, and decrease items added into a database.
The application can send an alert to a user if the stock drops low via a radio button on the setting menu of the app. The inventory is organized into a grid view. 
## 
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application uses four screens including a login, gride view display of inventory, setting and notification, and an add items flow. 
To keep the user in mind while developing the UI the screens in the application use a variety of greens and blues to stay within theme and each screen flows to one another without being confusing or misleading. 
This application worked well for the first of its type I had developed as I followed along end ensured I kept to the android core application quality doc. 
## 
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
To code this application, I had big ambitions to start and tried adding too many features in. This slowed the process and ultimately ended in a scrapped application as I had more features and less running application.
Moving forward from this I started with a working application then started implementing features such as the notification system or the menu in the application. 
In the future during development I know I’ll need to start with a working app before adding features to it.  
## 
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure that my code was function and running I tested on different emulated devices in the Android IDK with different screen sizes such as different pixel devices and different tables. 
This is important as when developing an application the developer may have a device in mind, the in practice the end user could be using the application on a variety of different devices.  
## 
# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Initially I struggled with getting everything together. I had the notification screen set up but couldn’t get it to flow with menu and initially had not really understood how to connect the radio button.
I worked through some tutorials online and create the switch from there.
## 
# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
## 
I enjoyed creating the log in authentication screen. I’ve enjoyed the most working with SQL and its different flavors such as mySQL and noSQL and look forward to pairing different programming languages with database integration.
